## Description

It's almost that time of year ghosts and ghouls. Join us for our annual Halloween party when the spirits come out to code. Costumes not required, but always appreciated. Celebrate with lightning talks, a hackathon, and Open Source Trico-or-Treat goodies.

#### Lightning Talks Open Mic

Want to give a five-minute talk on something you learned recently, or maybe show off a side project you are working on? Tonight it's an open mic for speakers.

#### Open Source Trick Or Treat

Choose trick or treat goodies from our bucket of Open Source project merch. T-shirts, stickers, coffee cups, stuffed animals, socks, and lots more from some of our favorite projects merch stores.

#### Halloween Hackathon

Team up or work alone, build a Halloween themed project and win prizes. Prizes and prize categories will be announced soon.

#### Food and snacks

As always we will have food and drinks provided by an awesome local restaurant to be determined.

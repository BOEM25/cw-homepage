## Description

Discord Bot Starter Kit is a simple NodeJS project to get you up and running with a functional Discord bot. Follow along in the video for instructions on creating a Discord Application in the Developer Console, creating a bot user, adding the bot to your server, and finally hooking up the starter kit code to the bot. From there you can enhance your bot to do whatever you want!

## Resources

Note: You should install NodeJS before trying to follow along with this, it isn't covered in the video, but you can download and install it here. https://nodejs.org/en/download/

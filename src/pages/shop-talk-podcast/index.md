### Friendly and Fun
Every Code Workshop event is a chance to have fun and explore. Building a great friendly community
is one of our core values and we will always strive for a fun and friendly atmosphere.

### Inclusive
People from all walks of life, careers, and backgrounds are welcome to join us at our events.
We want to make programming as open and accessible to as many people as possible, and never be
exclusionary.

### High Quality Content
Every workshop we host aims to be a fully developed and rewarding experience. Our goal
it to teach high quality coding practices and ideas that are as applicable to beginners
as they are to seasoned professionals. Every event is designed around a curriculum designed
to teach concepts clearly and correctly.

### Engaging and Participatory
We believe that doing is learning. We minimize the amount of lecture time at our events and
instead focus on interactive exercises and participation. Each event will have clear learning goals,
and facilitators available to help with any questions that you may have and to provide guidance.

### Open Source
As members of the software community we stand on the shoulders of many amazing open source software
projects, and a core value of our organization is to promote the usage of and contribution to open source software projects.
